## What do we got here? Well, let me tell you! 

Here in this repository, you will find all the code I used and that would be needed to recreate the data gathering and EDA I performed for my blog post covering data from the University of Utah's 2008 football season. All enclusive other than my API code of course. You'll need to get your own one of those. ðŸ˜‰

I have included a .ipynb file containing all my lines of code in data chunks, grouping as made sense to me, to help you see what is going on and hopefully to help you test things out step-by-step.

My goal behind this analysis was to hopefully find some interesting insights about the successful season they had that year and what the various data about each individual drive from those games say in regards to how they found success.

I hope you will find my findings interesting as well and that this is helpful in helping you do your own analysis!!
